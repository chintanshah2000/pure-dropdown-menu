pure-dropdown-menu
==================

A simple dropdown menu for [Pure CSS framework] (https://github.com/yui/pure). Give it a try - [pure dropdown menu] (http://demo.narcisradu.ro/pure-dropdown). Support for IE7 has been dropped - [details] (https://github.com/yui/pure/issues/365); [IE7 branch] (https://github.com/narcis-radu/pure-dropdown-menu/tree/ie7) still has support.

### Browser Support and Testing
The code was tested in:
* IE 8+
* Latest Stable: Firefox, Chrome, Safari
* iOS 7+

### Issues and Requests
Feel free to contact

### NOTE
This is work in progress. I still need to add support for small/ touch devices.
