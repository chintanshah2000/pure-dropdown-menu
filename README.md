pure-dropdown-menu
==================

A simple dropdown menu for [Pure CSS framework] (https://github.com/yui/pure). Support for IE7 was added using [expressions] (https://github.com/narcis-radu/pure-dropdown-menu/blob/master/pure-dropdown.css#L26-L39). Give it a try - [pure dropdown menu] (demo.narcisradu.ro/pure-dropdown).

You can integrate this into [Pure] (https://github.com/yui/pure), but when you build from source, CSS Lint verification will fail because of the IE hacks. If you want to force the build, try `grunt --force`.

### Browser Support and Testing
The code was tested in:
* IE 7+
* Latest Stable: Firefox, Chrome, Safari
* iOS 7

### Issues and Requests
Feel free to contact

### NOTE
This is work in progress. I still need to add support for small/ touch devices.
